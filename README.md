# Mendable Python SDK

This is a Python SDK for Mendable.ai, which provides a Python interface to interact with Mendable.ai's API.

## Installation

To install this package, use pip:

```bash
pip install mendable-py
```

## Prerequisites

To use this package, you'll need to obtain an API key from Mendable.ai and make it available as an environment variable or set it in the constructor.

In your environment (add to .env file):

```bash
MENDABLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

OR

```python
my_chat_bot = ChatApp(api_key="your-api-key")
```


## Usage

You can use this package to add sources to Mendable and ask questions to it:

```python
from mendable import ChatApp

my_chat_bot = ChatApp(api_key="your-api-key")

my_chat_bot.add("url", "https://www.mendable.ai/")

answer = my_chat_bot.query("What is Mendable?")
print(answer)
```

## Check and Delete Indexes

You can also check/delete indexes using `get_sources` and `delete_source` functions:

```python
from mendable import ChatApp

my_chat_bot = ChatApp(api_key="your-api-key")

my_chat_bot.add("url", "https://www.mendable.ai/")

my_chat_bot.get_sources()

my_chat_bot.delete_source("https://www.mendable.ai/")
```
